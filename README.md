# FinalTask_Kalbe_DS_Chania-Dwintania
As a Data Scientist at Kalbe Nutritionals, I am currently involved in two projects. 
I've been tasked by the inventory team with assisting in the prediction of daily sales quantities for all Kalbe products. The goal of this project is to estimate the quantity of products sold in order for the inventory team to maintain adequate daily stock levels, and these forecasts must be made on a daily basis. 
The marketing team, on the other hand, has tasked me with creating customer clusters or segments based on various criteria. The goal here is to create customer segments that the marketing team can use to provide personalized promotions and tailored sales strategies.
